  "summary": "The diff shows HeroSection.tsx updated to use '/assets/generated/profile-photo.png' as both primary source (via data.profilePhoto) and fallback (onError handler), and cv.ts updated to set profilePhoto to that local path. The fallback-on-error behavior is preserved. However, there is no evidence in the diff that the actual image file was downloaded and saved to frontend/public/assets/generated/profile-photo.png — no binary file addition is shown.",

      "reason": "The diff shows no added files. The image file frontend/public/assets/generated/profile-photo.png does not appear in the 'ADDED FILES' section, meaning the actual binary asset may not have been downloaded and saved. The code references the path but the file itself is not confirmed present.",

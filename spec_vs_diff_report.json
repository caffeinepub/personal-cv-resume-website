  "summary": "REQ-1 is substantially implemented: HeroSection.tsx now uses data.profilePhoto (the LinkedIn URL) as the initial src with the local asset as onError fallback, and existing alt text/className are preserved. The LinkedIn URL is set in cv.ts profilePhoto field. However, the URL in cv.ts contains a minor character discrepancy ('F8u1' vs the required 'F8v1'), which may cause the image to fail to load. Additionally, referrerPolicy='no-referrer' was added to the img element, which was not explicitly requested.",

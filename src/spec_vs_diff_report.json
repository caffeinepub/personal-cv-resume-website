REQ-1 (static profile photo asset at the specified public path, with Hero img continuing to reference it) is not evidenced in the diff summary (no asset added, HeroSection change not shown). There is also an apparent addition of a Twitter contact method that was not requested and conflicts with the stated non-goal of not adding new contact methods.",
